			<h2 id="teach_heading" class="headings">A note from Dr. Lever - </h2>
			<p id="teach_note" class="pageText">My teaching philosophy is to make learning fun, and therefore, memorable. To accomplish this challenging goal, I routinely incorporate stories of real life experiences and hands-on demonstrations while teaching, all the while utilizing multiple learning modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile and combinations thereof) to optimize retention and critical thinking of new material. This dynamic approach emerged from my doctoral training program at East Carolina University, during which time I enrolled in several graduate courses in the Education Department to become proficient in teaching adult learners.<br><br>
			I consider myself to be a tough but energetic and entertaining educator who strives to maximize each student’s learning potential. My most challenging teaching role thus far entails research mentorship, which necessitates keeping students interested in learning amidst the typical slow pace and have provided research mentorship to an exceptionally large number of trainees at MU. The daily one-on-one and small group learning environment in my lab has facilitated marked refinement of my teaching style to further enhance learning outcomes, regardless of the learning environment (i.e., classroom, lab, or clinic).<br><br>
			By far, the most exciting part of research mentoring is seeing where my students go in life. I am thrilled that many have been accepted into top programs in their chosen fields. For example, Iyas Daghlas, and undergraduate student in biochemistry who I mentored for 4 years, is currently in his 2nd year at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Bridget Hopewell, an ENT resident physician who conducted research in my lab from 2014 - 2016, is currently in a top fellowship program in laryngology at Vanderbilt University. Elizabeth Bearce, an undergraduate food and nutrition science major who I mentored during her senior year and a post-graduate year, is currently a 3rd year doctoral student in biology at Boston College, where she received a full scholarship. I am especially thrilled that all of the pre-med students affiliated with my lab have been accepted into medical school. Similarly, all of my medical students have been accepted into a residency program in their targeted specialty area – otolaryngology for the majority, but other specialties include plastic surgery, neurology, urology, and internal medicine. I especially cherish the numerous “thank you” notes from my current and past mentees – their endearing words of gratitude completely cover my refrigerator at home and bulletin boards in my lab and office, providing a constant reminder that I have indeed contributed to their academic and life achievements. </p>

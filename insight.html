		<h2 class="headings insight_headings">Our Focus</h2>
		<p class= "pageText focus_text">Our research is focused on dysphagia (i.e., swallowing impairment), which can be caused by a variety of neurological disorders ranging from fatal degenerative diseases (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS) to surgically-induced (iatrogenic) laryngeal nerve injury that can occur during anterior neck procedures such as thyroidectomy and cervical spine surgery. Dysphagia in these conditions significantly contributes to a poor quality of life, major depression, decreased general health, and increased risk of life-threatening aspiration pneumonia. Current treatments are predominantly palliative rather than curative because the underlying pathological mechanisms that cause dysphagia remain largely unknown for each condition. Our research addresses this major clinical problem by studying mice, which have a compressed life cycle (~2 years) that permits longitudinal investigations throughout the disease course and across the life-span to accelerate the scientific discovery process. While numerous mouse models of neurological conditions currently exist, they have rarely been studied relative to dysphagia. This lack of attention is surprising, given that dysphagia is a serious consequence of most neurological disorders. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="headings insight_headings">Goals</h2>
		<p>
			<ol class="focus_text pageText">
				<li>Establish mouse models of dysphagia for a variety of neurological disorders, thereby strengthening the translational potential of these models to ultimately benefit humans. </li>
				<li>Elucidate the mechanisms underlying dysphagia, which are likely different for each neurological disorder. </li>
				<li>Develop novel, effective treatments for dysphagia in mouse models of neurological disorders to implement in clinical trials with patients. </li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h2 class="headings insight_headings">What we have accomplished</h2>
		<p>
			<ul class="focus_text pageText">
				<li>Successfully adapted the two gold-standard clinical diagnostic tests for dysphagia (i.e., videofluoroscopy and endoscopy) to permit longitudinal investigations in mice</li>
				<li> Developed miniaturized test equipment and novel test protocols for fluoroscopic and endoscopic evaluations of swallowing in mice</li>
				<li> Establishment and validation of mouse models (i.e. ALS, serotonin deficiency, iatrogenic laryngeal nerve injury, and primary aging) which is currently being studied to elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms contributing to dysphagia</li>
				<li> Exploration of candidate treatment strategies to delay, slow, or reverse the underlying neuropathology of dysphagia</li>
				<li> Several fruitful collaborations
					<ul>
						<li> Dr. Nicole Nichols, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at University of Missouri, Columbia, MO</li>
						<li> Dr. Filiz Bunyak,  Assistant Professor and Computational Expert in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of Missouri, Columbia, MO</li>
						<li> Navid Khodaparast, PhD, Neuroscientist and Director of Clinical Research at Nexeon Medsystems, Inc., Dallas, TX</li>
						<li> Mai El Mallah, MD, Pulmonologist at the University of Massachusettes Medical School in Worcester, MA</li>
						<li> Kazutaka Takahashi, PhD, Neurophysiologist at the University of Chicago</li>
						<li> Irene Zohn, PhD, Neuroscientist at George Washington University, Washington, DC</li>
				</ul>
				<li> Development of a videofluoroscopic dysphagia diagnostic test for dogs that permits direct comparisons to humans</li> 
				<li> Developed a custom test kennel and clinical protocol to evaluate dysphagia in dogs. This innovative test eliminates the need for restraint and force-feeding methods that are widely used in veterinary medicine, and significantly reduces radiation exposure to veterinary personnel</li> 
				<li> Awarded a US patent (see Section B below) for our innovative dysphagia diagnostic test for dogs, and we are currently in negotiations with an interested industry partner for sponsored research and product commercialization</li> 
				<li> Two active IRB-approved studies that have directly resulted from my research findings with mouse models, and entail developing novel clinical tools to facilitate early detection and monitoring of dysphagia 
					<ul>

						<li> Mobile health app in collaboration with three MU faculty â€“ Dr. Mili Kuruvilla-Dugdale from the CSD Department, and Drs. Filiz Bunyak and Yunxin Zhao from the EECS Department</li>
						<li> Novel medical device to test an airway protective reflex that becomes pathological in dysphagic patients, which is a collaborative effort with Drs. Filiz Bunyak and Henry He from the EECS Department at MU</li> 
					</ul></li>
